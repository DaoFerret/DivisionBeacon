# DivisionBeacon
Arduino code to drive an overly complex ISAC/Discord Shoulder Beacon module (and the remote to control it)

The purpose of this repository is two fold.
1) Get my mind around the code I first wrote about a year ago, so I can make enhancements to it.
2) Make the code available to other people who might find it interesting or useful to work with.

ToDo:
- Add Volume code to the Settings menu (now that I've reworked the physical shell so the speaker isn't muted by plastic) (possibly before Dragon\*Con 2017)
- Add Brightness code to the settings menu (maybe).
- Get the "playlist" mode working (right now it does nothing.  It SHOULD play the tracks in order and allow you to randomize that order if you want.
