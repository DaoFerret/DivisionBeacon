# DivisionBeacon
Arduino code to drive an overly complex ISAC/Discord Shoulder Beacon module (and the remote to control it)

The purpose of this repository is two fold.
1) Get my mind around the code I first wrote about a year ago, so I can make enhancements to it.
2) Make the code available to other people who might find it interesting or useful to work with.
